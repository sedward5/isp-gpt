## Endpoint Security

At [Company Name], we understand the importance of securing endpoint devices as they can be a vulnerable entry point for security threats. 

All employees are provided with company-issued Mac laptops for work purposes. Personal laptops are not permitted to access [Company Name] systems or data to prevent potential security risks.

Employees may use personal mobile devices for work-related activities but are required to follow specific guidelines designed to safeguard our information systems. All devices that access our corporate data or networks, including personal mobile devices, must have the prescribed security and monitoring software installed.

These security tools are necessary to detect, prevent, and mitigate threats. They will be deployed and managed by our IT department to ensure they are appropriately configured and updated. Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in the removal of access privileges to our corporate data and networks.

In addition, all employees must follow our secure device use guidelines, including:

1. Ensuring their devices are locked when not in use.
2. Updating the device's operating system and applications regularly to include the latest security patches.
3. Not installing unauthorized applications or circumventing any of the security features and controls in place.

All endpoint devices are subject to our incident response process, and any device suspected of being compromised must be reported to the IT department immediately.

Our endpoint security measures, coupled with our overall security policy, aim to create a robust security environment that promotes the safe use of technology and protects [Company Name] and our clients from potential threats.
