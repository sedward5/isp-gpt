Sure, let's develop a procedure for **Threat Intelligence Procedure**

**1. Threat Intelligence Collection:**

    1.1 Designated Security Analyst(s) will be responsible for subscribing to, monitoring, and gathering data from a variety of reliable internal and external sources. These can include alerts from security software, cybersecurity news outlets, security forums, newsletters, etc.
    
    1.2 Staff members should report any suspicious activities or threats they come across during their daily work via the designated communication channel.
    
**2. Threat Intelligence Analysis:**

    2.1 The collected data should be reviewed by the Security Analyst(s) on a daily basis, at minimum.

    2.2 Analysts will use ChatGPT to assist in the analysis process. This involves inputting the collected data into the model and interpreting the output for actionable insights. The system will help identify patterns, correlations, and potential threats relevant to the organization.

**3. Threat Integration:**

    3.1 The Security Analyst(s) should map the identified threats to the organization's existing security systems and practices to understand the risk exposure. 

    3.2 They should also identify any indicators of compromise (IoCs) within the organizationâ€™s environment and network.

**4. Dissemination of Findings:**

    4.1 The Security Analyst(s) should communicate significant threat intelligence findings to the relevant stakeholders within the organization, typically through a security briefing or report.

    4.2 Where immediate action is required, the Security Analyst(s) should directly communicate the findings to the IT team or the concerned department for immediate response.

**5. Review and Improvement:**

    5.1 On a quarterly basis, the Threat Intelligence process should be reviewed for effectiveness. This includes reviewing the sources of intelligence, methods of analysis, and the effectiveness of the integration.

    5.2 Any changes or improvements to the process should be documented and communicated to the relevant stakeholders.
