## Incident Response Policy

At [Company Name], we understand the critical importance of responding swiftly and effectively in the event of a security incident. The purpose of this policy is to define the actions to be taken in case of a security incident and to minimize its impact on business operations.

**Incident Identification and Classification**

All employees, contractors, vendors, or any third-party entities involved in [Company Name]'s operations are responsible for immediately reporting any perceived or actual security incidents. An incident can include, but is not limited to, unauthorized access to systems, suspicious emails, data breaches, and malware infections.

Upon notification of an incident, our security team will classify the incident based on its severity and potential impact. 

**Incident Response Team**

The Incident Response Team (IRT) will consist of members from our security, IT, legal, and communications departments. The IRT will be responsible for managing the response to all reported incidents.

**Incident Response Procedures**

The IRT will follow these key steps upon confirmation of a security incident:

1. **Containment**: Limit the scope and magnitude of the incident to prevent further damage.
2. **Investigation**: Gather evidence and details about the incident to identify the root cause and affected systems or data.
3. **Eradication**: Remove the cause of the incident and any associated vulnerabilities.
4. **Recovery**: Restore affected systems and data to normal operation, ensuring they are secure.
5. **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct a thorough analysis of the incident, response actions, and outcomes. Identify lessons learned and update procedures and controls as necessary.

**Communication**

The IRT will coordinate communications related to the incident, both internally and externally. This may include notifying affected customers, regulatory bodies, or law enforcement agencies, as required by law or in the best interest of [Company Name].

**Training and Awareness**

All employees will receive annual training on this policy, including how to identify and report potential security incidents.

**Review and Update**

This policy will be reviewed and updated annually, or as required, to ensure that it continues to be relevant and effective.

This Incident Response Policy forms an integral part of our broader commitment to maintaining the security and integrity of our systems and data, and to providing reliable and secure services to our customers.
