**Threat Intelligence Policy**

**Purpose**
This policy provides guidance on how to conduct threat intelligence activities to ensure the protection of our organization's information assets.

**Policy**
1. **Monitoring**
   * The organization will continuously monitor various sources, including trusted security news sites, industry reports, and automated threat feeds, to stay informed about emerging threats and vulnerabilities that are relevant to its industry and technology stack.

2. **Analysis**
   * Upon identification of a potential threat or vulnerability, a detailed analysis will be conducted to assess its relevance to the organization and the potential impact on our systems and data.
   * The analysis will take into account our existing security controls and whether they are sufficient to mitigate the threat.

3. **Reporting**
   * An intelligence report will be created for each significant threat analysis, outlining the threat or vulnerability, its potential impact, and recommended mitigation strategies or controls.
   * All threat intelligence reports will be promptly communicated to relevant stakeholders, which may include the IT department, executive management, and potentially affected business units.

4. **Response**
   * Recommended actions from threat intelligence reports will be reviewed and, if approved, incorporated into our information security procedures. This could involve updating existing controls, implementing new controls, or altering business processes to mitigate the risk.

**Responsibilities**
The IT department, or designated security personnel, are responsible for conducting threat intelligence activities and documenting their findings. All employees and contractors are responsible for cooperating with any changes to procedures or controls that result from threat intelligence activities.

**Review**
This policy will be reviewed at least annually, or whenever significant changes are made to the organization's systems or threat landscape, to ensure it remains effective and relevant.
