**Third-Party Vendor Assessment Policy**

1. **Policy Statement**
The purpose of this Third-Party Vendor Assessment Policy is to establish a standard process for evaluating the security practices of third-party vendors that access, process, store, or transmit company data. This policy helps to ensure that such vendors maintain appropriate security controls and adhere to the same high standards of data security as we do.

2. **Scope**
This policy applies to all third-party vendors that will have access to company data, including personal identifiable information (PII), or have the capability to impact the security of our information systems.

3. **Policy Guidelines**

   **3.1 Initial Assessment**

   - All proposed third-party vendor engagements must undergo an initial security assessment before approval.
   - The requesting department must provide a detailed description of the proposed engagement, including data handling, vendor security certifications, and any other relevant information.
   - Security team will review the provided data, including the vendor's most recent audit reports, such as SOC 2, and other compliance certifications.
   
   **3.2 Data Access Evaluation**

   - The security team will evaluate the extent of data access and permissions the vendor will have, particularly when APIs are involved. This evaluation aims to ensure minimum necessary access is granted and that proper controls are in place to prevent unauthorized data access.

   **3.3 Review of Security Practices**

   - The security team will assess the vendor's vulnerability management program, including frequency of vulnerability scans, remediation time frames, and penetration testing practices.
   - Any identified vulnerabilities and remediation activities will be reviewed for adequacy.

   **3.4 Approval/Rejection**

   - Following the assessment, the security team will document their findings and either approve or reject the proposed vendor engagement.
   - The security team may request additional information or actions to be taken by the vendor as a condition of approval.

   **3.5 Ongoing Vendor Monitoring**

   - Approved vendors will be subject to ongoing monitoring to ensure continued compliance with our security standards.
   - Regular updates or check-ins will be scheduled with vendors to review any changes in their security posture.

   **3.6 Employee Training**

   - Employees will receive the necessary training on how to use the approved vendor's service securely, particularly when the service integrates with their workstations or email.

This policy helps us maintain strong security controls and minimize risk associated with third-party vendors. All employees and vendors must adhere to this policy. Non-compliance will be addressed promptly and may lead to disciplinary action.

**Review and Updates**
This policy will be reviewed annually and updated as needed to reflect changes in business requirements, technology, or threats.
